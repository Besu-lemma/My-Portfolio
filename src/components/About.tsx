                My interest in technology started back in high school and grew
                stronger during my Computer Science studies at Jimma University.
                Throughout university, I worked on real-world projects through
                internships, academic collaborations, and hands-on learning.

                Iâ€™ve built a smart irrigation system for Ethiopian farmers with
                support for local languages (Amharic and Afaan Oromo),
                AI-powered recommendations, and a mobile app. I also developed a
                product showcase site for Furtu Construction, a multilingual
                chat app, and an exchange rate tracker currently in progress.
              </p>

                I earned 2nd place in a university hackathon for solving local
                delivery challenges and continue to focus on building tech that
                addresses real-world problems and brings impact to communities.
